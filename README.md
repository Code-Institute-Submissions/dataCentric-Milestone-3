# Recipe Sharing - Data-Centric-Milestone-3


## Introduction
This project is developed with the intention for users to share their recipes with others. The main functions of this Recipe Sharing revolves around the 4 functionalities- Create, Read, Update, Delete.

Database was stored and retrieved from the backend (MongoDB).

I chose to do recipe sharing as I enjoy cooking and wish to share my personal recipes with others. Likewise, I am also interested in other people's recipes and I can also try them out on my own.

## Demo


## UX
| User Stories        | Description   |  
| :------------- |:-------------| 
| 1    | As someone who enjoys cooking, I want to share my recipes with like-minded people so that they can whips dishes that they also like.|
| 2    | As a person who does not know much about cooking, I want to have access to various recipes so that I have the steps for recipes that may interest me.|
| 3    | As a general user, I wish that there are such recipe sharing platforms so that I can use them whenever I need. |


The website will be designed based on the identified goals and hence allow users to do the following:

-add new recipes to the website where they can include the cuisines, the recipe name, the ingredients, and the cooking steps.

-edit any recipe on the website.

-view details of the individual recipes

-delete any recipe.

-search recipe by cuisines.
