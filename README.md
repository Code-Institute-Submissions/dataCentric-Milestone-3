# Recipe Sharing - Data-Centric-Milestone-3


## Introduction
This project is developed with the intention for users to share their recipes with others. The main functions of this Recipe Sharing revolves around the 4 functionalities- Create, Read, Update, Delete.

Database was stored and retrieved from the backend (MongoDB).

I chose to do recipe sharing as I enjoy cooking and wish to share my personal recipes with others. Likewise, I am also interested in other people's recipes and I can also try them out on my own.

## Demo


## UX/UI
### Project Strategy
| User Stories        | Description   |  
| :------------- |:-------------| 
| 1    | As someone who enjoys cooking, I want to share my recipes with like-minded people so that they can whips dishes that they also like.|
| 2    | As a person who does not know much about cooking, I want to have access to various recipes so that I have the steps for recipes that may interest me.|
| 3    | As a general user, I wish that there are such recipe sharing platforms so that I can use them so whenever I need. |


### Project Scope
<!--The website will be designed based on the identified goals and hence placed in the following sections in a main page:-->

<!--Search Bar: This will allow users to search for a specific title/keyword of movies where the list of movies will appear on the first row (which is at the Default Movies Row). Search results are not limited to a region.-->

<!--Default Movies Row: The first row of the page displays a list of preset movies in relation to a keyword, which in this case it is preset to the keyword ‘Avengers’. Users will be able to see the videos/trailers upon clicking on the particular movie that they want. When users search for movies, the results will also appear in this row. -->

<!--Top Rated Movies Row: This row will display about 20 Top Rated Movies. Users will be able to see the videos/trailers when they click on the movie. This is specified to a region with an added parameter which I have set to SG (Singapore).-->

<!--Popular Movies Row: This row will display about 20 Popular Movies. Users will be able to see the videos/trailers when they click on the movie. This is specified to a region with an added parameter which I have set to SG (Singapore).-->

<!--Upcoming Movies Row: This row will display about 20 Upcoming Movies. Users will be able to see the videos/trailers when they click on the movie. This is specified to a region with an added parameter which I have set to SG (Singapore).-->

<!--Now Playing Row: This row will display about 20 movies that are Now Playing. Users will be able to see the videos/trailers when they click on the movie. This is specified to a region with an added parameter which I have set to SG (Singapore).-->
